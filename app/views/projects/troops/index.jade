					p This is an attempt to use WebRtc as a replacement to bluetooth &amp; and other communication channels and create a meta-communication platform for multimedia. The end goal is to stream content to any associated device in realtime. These devices can be your mobile, tv, speakers, other peoples devices. What I am trying to achieve here is eliminate any all intermediary protocol and adopt WebRtc as the universal adapter.
